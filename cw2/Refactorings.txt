Refactorings
Replace magic numbers with constants
Replace repeated code with a function
Change of variable name (as code needs comment to explain what it is for)
Separate a complex expression into a local variable
Replace loop with iterator (smell: Loop variable is an integer from 1 to something.)
- iterator: traverse a collection and for a sequential access of items in a collection
- loop: traverse items in a collection
- if modifying collection: iterator
- if using nested for loops: for each loop
Replace hand-written code with library code
Replace set of arrays with array of structures
Replace constants with configuration file (yaml)
Replace global variables with function arguments
Merge neighbouring loops
Break a large function into smaller units
Separate code concepts into files or modules

Object Refactorings
Replace ad-hoc structure with user defined classes
Replace function with a method
If function is always called with the same kind of thing: Replace method arguments with class members
If a variable is nearly always used in arguments to a class: Replace global variable with class and member
Replace a global variable with class and member
